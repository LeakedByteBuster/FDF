FDF is a project that aims to create a wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by connecting various points using line segments (edges). The program renders the model in an isometric projection.

## Usage

To run the FDF project, follow these steps:
```
$> git clone https://github.com/Mushigarou/FDF.git
$> cd fdf
$> make
$> ./bin/fdf maps/file.fdf
```
## File Format

The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file. Each number in the file represents a point in 3D space, where:

- The horizontal position corresponds to the x-axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to the y-axis.
- The value represents the altitude.

Make sure that the .fdf file is properly formatted to avoid unexpected behavior.
## Features

- The program displays the wireframe model in a window.
- Smooth window management allows easy navigation between windows.
- Pressing the ```ESC key or clicking the window's close button``` gracefully closes the program.
- The MiniLibX library is used to handle graphics and images.
- One extra projection parallel! `use p to change projection `
- Zoom in and out. `use - and + signs`
- Translate your model. `use arrow keys`
